# Password-Generator

**Overview**

The purpose of this project was to create a password generator with the following criteria:

> ```
> GIVEN I need a new, secure password
> WHEN I click the button to generate a password
> THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
> WHEN prompted for password criteria
> THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
> WHEN prompted for the length of the password
> THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
> WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
> THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
> WHEN I answer each prompt
> THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
> WHEN all prompts are answered
> THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
> WHEN the password is generated
> THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
> ```

**Technologies**

> This password generator was created with HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript. First the user is prompted for what characters they would like to include in their password from a list of arrays containing the characters. The user is then asked how long they would like their password to be from 8-128 characters. The user's inputs are used to propagate as many characters as requested from those selected to use.

**Future Development**

> Beyond the random character generation, this application could have more functions written into it where the user can input memorable phrases or numbers as to make the password more easy to remember, while maintaining it's strength.
